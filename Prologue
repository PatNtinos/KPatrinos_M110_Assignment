🧙‍♂️ "Dream Working Place: The Dungeon Keeper" — Legendary Opening Script

[Fade in – Monday morning. Grey skies. The faint sound of alarm clocks and sighs.]

Narrator (or player thought):
Another boring Monday. Two hours of Literature first thing in the morning.
Oh mannnn… why does it always have to be Mondays?
And why does it always have to be Literature?

You drag your feet past your creepy old neighbor’s house — cobwebs, weird smells, and that one window that’s always watching.

You (muttering):
I hate Mondays… and I hate Literature…
I wish something interesting would happen for once.

[Something glints on the old neighbor’s trash bin.]

You (squinting):
Huh? What’s that…?
A fancy lamp? No way.

You pick it up, give it a quick rub to clean the dust—

💥 POOF!
Smoke fills the air, glowing blue and gold.

Genie (booming voice):
Thank you for summoning me, Master!
I shall grant you three wishes!

You (stunned):
Wait, seriously?! Oh—this is awesome!!!

Overcome with excitement, you shout without thinking:
"I wish I didn’t have Literature today!"

Genie:
Granted, Master!

[Your phone buzzes. Headmaster calling.]

Headmaster (on phone):
Your Literature teacher’s sick. No class today.

You (pumping fist):
OH YEAH!!! Best day ever!

Genie:
Two wishes remain, Master.

You grin. The possibilities feel endless.

You:
Alright… second wish. I hate Mondays.
I wish there were no more Mondays!

Genie (snaps fingers):
Granted! Mondays have been erased from existence!

[A strange rumble shakes the ground.]

You (confused):
Wait—what’s happening?!

Genie:
Oh, nothing serious… Time just rearranged itself a bit.
Now Tuesdays happen right after Sundays.

You:
Huh… so… no school after Sundays?

Genie (smiling):
Of course there is, Master. It’s just called Tuesday now.

You (facepalming):
You’re kidding me… I’ve just made Tuesdays worse!

Genie (cheerfully):
Indeed. Shall we continue with your final wish?
You pause. Think.
And then you remember your weekend — endless hours of Caves of Chaos, the new dungeon crawler game.
You smirk.

You:
Alright. I’ve got it.
I wish…
I didn’t have to go to school anymore.
I wish…
to work in a dungeon!

Genie (grinning):
Granted, Master!

[WHOOSH — blinding light. The world spins.]

You open your eyes…
You’re standing in a dim, eerie dungeon.
Dripping walls. Faint torches. The smell of damp stone and regret.

You (drawing imaginary sword):
Oh YES! My shining armor! My destiny!
Time to slay monsters, grab loot, and kiss a princess or two!

[A raspy voice interrupts.]

Old Gremlin:
Oh good, you’re here! The new Dungeon Keeper, right?

You:
Heh, yeah. Finally someone who recognizes a hero when they see one.

Gremlin:
Hero?
Ha! No, no, no.
You’re not the hero, kid — you’re the help.

You:
Wait… what?

Gremlin:
Yep. You’re the dungeon’s new everything guy.
You’ll be fixing broken walls, hiring monsters, laying traps, filling out loot forms, writing down every wannabe hero who comes raiding…
Oh, and don’t forget the weekly slime disposal reports.

You:
What?! No epic quests? No golden loot? No princesses?!

Gremlin:
Nope. Just paperwork, maintenance, and the occasional skeleton HR complaint.

You:
You’ve gotta be kidding me…

Gremlin (chuckling):
Nope. I’ve been stuck here for centuries — and now, finally, it’s your turn.
I leave this cursed office to you, Dungeon Keeper.
Good luck! You’ll need it.

[The gremlin vanishes in a puff of dust.]

You (looking around):
…Well.
Guess it’s time to clock in.

[Cue title screen: “Dream Working Place: The Dungeon Keeper”]
[Dramatic fantasy music plays with a faint bureaucratic stamp sound: THUD!]
